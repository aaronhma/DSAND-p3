# Problem 1 Explanation

This problem was solved by applying binary search. The low starts from 2, as if the input is less than 2 or negative, it is impossible to calculate the sqrt(). Also, the high value is input // 2 to save time.

- Time complexity: O(log n) - binary search
- Spsce complexity: O(1)
